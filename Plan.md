# Plan 
## Building 2D version

### Model_1
1.)Inside the iteration loop , first get the distance value 
second get the acceleration 
and finally update the position and velocity of each body .

2.)Add the collision mechanism 

3.)At the end of iteration loop , plot the points and set the animation mechanism
